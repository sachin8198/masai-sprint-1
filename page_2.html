            <p>Homer Simpson is selfish, gluttonous, ignorant, rash, and proud of all those things. He's a man of simple pleasures — beer, doughnuts, "snuggling" with Marge, sitting on the couch watching TV — who will do whatever it takes to get those pleasures. And yet, Homer contains multitudes. He's deeply in love and devoted to his wife, and he really wants to be a good parent to Bart and Lisa, although his son's bad behavior aggravates him to the point of strangulation, and he has a hard time relating to his sensitive, hyper-intelligent, artistic daughter. (As for Baby Maggie, "he's got nothing against" her.)

                    Homer Simpson is a complex man, and The Simpsons has provided more than 600 episodes for him to develop into one of the most fascinating and hilarious characters in television. But how did he get to be the man he is, the author of Homer, I Hardly Knew Me? Before he became a working stiff at the nuclear power plant, started driving a pink car, and began living in a suburban tract house with three kids, he lived a lot of life — several lifetimes, even. Here's Homer Simpson's backstory explained.

                When The Simpsons graduated from a sketch on The Tracey Ullman Show to a full-length standalone series, Homer was 34 years old, according to the January 1991 episode "The Way We Was." Plus, the episode "Duffless" says Homer's birthday is May 12. So if we do a little bit of math, that means Homer was born in 1956.

                He then aged at a normal chronological rate, at least for a while, because in the late 1992 episode "Lisa the Beauty Queen," he's 36. After that, Homer's aging process slows down considerably. Four years after "Lisa the Beauty Queen," in the 1996 episode "The Homer They Fall," he's still in his late 30s. Two years after that (in 1998's "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace"), he has a midlife crisis when he realizes that at age 38.1, he's halfway to the male lifespan of 76.2. Homer finally hits the big 4-0 in the episode "Springfield Up," which aired nearly nine years after the episode where he freaked out about being 38.1.
