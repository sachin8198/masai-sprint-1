                Homer attended Springfield High School and fell in love with Marge Bouvier.[18] After graduating in June of 1974, Marge and Homer bought an apartment at Springfield Place together. During this time, Marge got a letter accepting her into a college. To pay for her tuition, Abe gives Homer a job at Simpson Laser Tag. The couple broke up for some time after Homer started a Grunge band called Sadgasm. Marge realizes that she really loves Homer, and she goes back to him.[19] At some point between finishing high school and marrying Marge, Homer briefly served in the US Army, but never saw combat. Due to a clerical error, he was discharged two weeks early and years later after a disastrous dinner party with his old sergeant, Homer was forced to complete his tour of duty.

                When the couple were in their mid-20s, Marge became pregnant with Bart. At this time Homer was working at Sir Putt-A-Lot's Merrie Olde Fun Centre, turning the crank that spins the windmill. The two got married in Shotgun Pete's 24 Hour Wedding Chapel, a small wedding chapel across the state line. They spent their wedding reception alone at a truck stop, before ending up at the Bouvier House, where they lived at the time. After failing to get a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer left Marge to find a job by

                which he could support his family. He went to work at a taco restaurant called the Gulp 'n' Blow until Marge found him and convinced him to return home with her. As a result, Homer confronted Mr. Burns and secured a job at the Plant.[20] Two years after Bart was born, Marge became pregnant with Lisa, shortly before they bought their first house.[21] Homer's second leap to stardom was his success as the lead singer and songwriter for the barbershop quartet The Be Sharps, even winning a Grammy. During his time with the group, Homer was frequently absent from home, which put stress on his marriage. After the group broke up due to creative differences, Homer went back to Springfield to continue his old life.[22]

                When in his 30s, Homer prepared a budget so that he could work at his dream job, a pin monkey at the Bowlarama Bowling Alley, owned by Barney's uncle Al Gumble. The budget included buying regular toilet paper and that only one of the kids could go to college. Unfortunately for Homer, Marge became pregnant with Maggie around this time, and he went back to the Nuclear Plant in order to support his family.[23] Since then, Homer has started many jobs, but in the end, he always comes back to his job at the Nuclear Plant. He has nearly caused the destruction of Springfield a couple of times, after a nuclear meltdown at the plant and polluting Lake Springfield with his pet pig's (and his own) waste.[24]
